# SimplePerceptronImplementation
Simple perceptron algorithm written with a decision boundary line demonstration after each epoch.
This is to demonstrate how perceptron works. 10 Data points are created by using scikit-learn make_classification function and decision boundary is plotted by using the the weights and bias. Bias value was chosen as "-1".
